## Laptops & Hybrids

### Laptop Characteristics

* A mobile computer with  
  * physical keyboard
  * the ability to run on battery power
  * ability to run desktop
* Laptop hardware can be highly variable
  * Range in size from **_netbooks(small/compact keyboards)_** to **_desktop replacements(Large/full set features and ports)_**
  * Nonstandard motherboards
  * Nonstandard fomr factors
  * Varying power supply components
* "Consumer" product lines incorporate new tech fast while "corporate" changes less over time
* Standardized interfaces for memory & peripherals devices

#### Main External Componets

* Hinged display assembly(Often includes mic, camera, & antenna).
